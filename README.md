# Viis numbrit (Five numbers in Estonian) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ª
Streamlit app to support practicing numbers in Estonian  
App link: https://viisnumbrit.streamlit.app/

# Usage
Choose the difficulty by specifying the maximum number possibly generated (up to 9999). 
You can choose between four practice modes, each focusing on different types of numbers:
1. cardinal (e.g. "six")
2. ordinal (e.g. "sixth")
3. cardinal + ordinal, randomly mixed
4. ordinal adessive (e.g. "on the sixth")

After clicking **Generate my numbers!**, the app generates five random numbers between 1 and your chosen maximum value and prompts you to type the numbers in letters. Once you're ready with your answers, click **Submit**. (Tip: you can leave them empty if you just want to check the correct answers quickly.) 
After submission, the app evaluates your answers and gives feedback along with the correct answers.
